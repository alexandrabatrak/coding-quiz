# Coding quiz

Bootcamp week 06: Code quiz :yellow_heart:

## About

Quiz-game application running in browser. This quiz allows to test one's knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals with a timed multiple choice quiz. Be aware, for every wrong answer the penalty is losing 10 seconds of the remaining time. Upon completion (or time run out) you are able to save your score, so you can challenge yourself next time again, until you get all the answers right!


### Features:

- [x] Interactive timed quiz
- [x] Option for user to select amount of questions (10/15/20)
- [x] Randomised questions, each with 4 randomised answer options
- [x] Time penalty on incorrect answer
- [x] Client-side scores saving and display of the top 10 scores (to save memory, only the last 100 scores are stored)
- [x] UI and sound effect feedback on correct/incorrect answer choice, variable ending sound based on the reason game ended - either all questions answered, or time run out
- [x] Option to switch the sound off (on by default)
- [x] Clean, polished and responsive mobile-first design
- [x] It's beautiful :ok_hand:
